      "Full Abstract: Genetic variants in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) gene have become an interesting topic for the study of genetic susceptibility to cancer, but their associations with the risk of gastric cancer have not been fully investigated. In a hospital-based case-control study of 1002 gastric cancer patients and 1003 cancer-free controls, we genotyped four potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1034528G>C, rs17036508T>C, rs3806317A>G, and rs2295080T>G) of mTOR and assessed their associations with the risk of gastric cancer using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. We also used the multifactorial dimension reduction analysis to explore possible interactions and the false-positive report probabilities to assess significant findings. We found that rs1034528 CG/CC and rs3806317 GA/GG variant genotypes were associated with an increased risk of gastric cancer under a dominant model (adjusted odds ratio=1.27 and 1.22, respectively). In the combined analysis of all four SNPs under investigation, patients with 3-4 risk genotypes of mTOR had a significantly increased risk of gastric cancer (adjusted odds ratio=1.46, 95% confidence interval=1.19-1.79) compared with those with 0-2 risk genotypes. Stratified analysis indicated that this risk was more pronounced in subgroups of men, never-smokers, never-drinkers, and clinical stages III+IV. The multifactorial dimension reduction analysis suggested some evidence of interactions between the combined genotypes and other risk factors for gastric cancer. These findings suggest that potentially functional SNPs of mTOR may individually or collectively contribute to the risk of gastric cancer. Larger studies with diverse ethnic populations are warranted to validate our findings.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Background: Several independent reports have indicated the efficacy of DNA damaging therapy for the oncological patients with loss of homolog recombination in consequence of BRCA 1,2 or PALB2 germiline mutation. There are similar works about pancreatic cancer but the frequency and localization of defects in these genes and the results of chemotherapy are variable. Methods: From 2009 to 2012 years 257 patients with PAC were included in the study. The analysis of the Russian founder mutation BRCA1 5382insC is performed in 150 PAC: 116 pacients included accidentally and 34 by the presence of kindreds with oncology. We had compared our results with the control group of 1007 healthy people. Prevalence of BRCA2 6174delT were analyzed in 22 cases. For these two genes we used allele specific real-time PCR. Full exon sequencing of coding region of BRCA2, PALB2 was conducted on DNA samples extracted from 8 patients by the HRM-analysis. For the administration of chemotherapy (ChT) we estimated a performance status by ECOG scale and efficacy by the RECIST criteria. Results: Two patients had carriers of BRCA1 mutation and one BRCA2 5197_5198delTC. In the control group only 1/1007 had BRCA1 allele. All patients with founder mutations had 2 or more kindreds with oncology and 1 had carriers of BRCA1 5382insC. Defects in the PALB 2 were not identified. ChT was administered only for 1 patients with BRCA2 allele because only he had a 1 score for ECOG scale. He had a 4 line of ChT (FOLFIRINOX, cisplatin, chlorambucil, mitomicin) and only in last one there was stabilization of the process by RECIST criteria and decrease the level of CA 19-9 from 3810 to 547 U/ml. FTP was a 4,1 months and overall survival 8,1. Conclusion: The frequency of BRCA1/2mutation carriers was rare for PAC but higher than in the general population and probability of detection was depended on familial history. It means that samples from patients with PAC whom had 2 or more relatives or kindred carrier of BRCA mutation should be selected for DNA analysis. The DNA crosslink agents are preferable for patients with BRCA mutation. Note: This abstract was not presented at the conference.

      "Full Abstract: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma exists in a complex desmoplastic microenvironment that provides stromal support for tumor growth and conceals the tumor from immune surveillance. Tumor-associated stroma comprises a mix of fibroblasts, immunosuppressive T regulatory cells (Tregs), myeloid suppressive monocytes (MDSCs) and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) that promote tumor growth and restrain immune-mediated tumor cell killing. The targeting of immune infiltrates may impair stromal support and enhance immune-mediated killing of pancreatic cancer cells. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) is a nonreceptor enzyme in the Tec kinase family expressed among cells of hematopoietic origin including B cells, myeloid cells, mast cells and platelets, but not T cells, where it regulates multiple cellular processes. Here we describe an unexpected finding of ACP-196, a potent, novel, second generation Btk inhibitor with improved selectivity and target coverage that binds covalently to a cysteine residue (Cys481) in the front position of the ATP-binding pocket. In an orthotopic mouse model of pancreatic cancer, KPC derived pancreatic cancer cells (KrasG12D; Trp53R172H; Pdx1-Cre) were injected into the pancreases. Vehicle, single agent ACP-196 (15 mg/kg/BID, gavage), single agent gemcitabine (50 mg/kg, IV) and combination ACP-196 with gemcitabine were evaluated for efficacy. By 4 weeks of treatment, mice in the vehicle group showed signs of health deterioration and all mice were euthanized, tumors were collected and measured. Relative to the vehicle treatment, ACP-196 monotherapy resulted in a >2-fold reduction in tumor growth compared with less than a 2-fold reduction with gemcitabine alone. The combination of ACP-196 and gemcitabine resulted in a further reduction in tumor growth when compared to each single agent. Interestingly, analysis of tumor tissues showed that single agent ACP-196 inhibited immunosuppressive populations of TAMs and MDSCs. Surprisingly, Treg populations were also reduced with a robust expansion of CD8+ T cells in the tumors. None of these effects were observed with gemcitabine alone. Although Btk is not expressed in T cells, this finding maybe the result of inhibiting the MDSC and TAM populations within the tumor microenvironment, a mechanism of action which is currently under investigation. Taken together, these data identify Btk as a novel target for modulating tumor immune escape and suggest that pharmacologic targeting of suppressive myeloid cells by ACP-196 induces therapeutic benefit. ACP-196 is currently being evaluated in clinical trials including frontline and salvage pancreatic cancer. Citation Format: Brian J. Lannutti, Michael Gulrajani, Fanny Krantz, Elena Bibikova, Todd Covey, Katti Jessen, Wayne Rothbaum, David M. Johnson, Roger Ulrich.

      "Full Abstract: The treatment of melanoma has been revolutionized over the past decade with the development of effective molecular and immune targeted therapies. The great majority of patients with melanoma have mutations in oncogenes that predominantly drive signaling through the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Analytic tools have been developed that can effectively stratify patients into molecular subsets based on the identification of mutations in oncogenes and/or tumor suppressor genes that drive the MAPK pathway. At the same time, potent and selective inhibitors of mediators of the MAPK pathway such as RAF, MEK, and ERK have become available. The most dramatic example is the development of single-agent inhibitors of BRAF (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, encorafenib) and MEK (trametinib, cobimetinib, binimetinib) for patients with metastatic BRAF V600 -mutant melanoma, a subset that represents 40% to 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma. More recently, the elucidation of mechanisms underlying resistance to single-agent BRAF inhibitor therapy led to a second generation of trials that demonstrated the superiority of BRAF inhibitor/MEK inhibitor combinations (dabrafenib/trametinib; vemurafenib/cobimetinib) compared to single-agent BRAF inhibitors. Moving beyond BRAF V600 targeting, a number of other molecular subsetssuch as mutations in MEK, NRAS, and non-V600 BRAF and loss of function of the tumor suppressor neurofibromatosis 1 ( NF1)are predicted to respond to MAPK pathway targeting by single-agent pan-RAF, MEK, or ERK inhibitors. As these strategies are being tested in clinical trials, preclinical and early clinical trial data are now emerging about which combinatorial approaches might be best for these patients.\n",

      "Full Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanism of resistance of a melanoma cell line generated from a direct in vivo xenograft (DIVX) model. Although BRAF and MKK1/2 inhibitors have produced positive clinical responses in melanoma patients with BRAF-V600 mutations, between 25-50% of patients show intrinsic resistance. Deciphering the mechanisms of intrinsic resistance will be critical for developing future treatment strategies. MB947P cells were established from a direct in vivo xenograft of a resected metastatic melanoma and exhibited innate resistance to apoptosis induced by MKK1/2 inhibitor (AZD6244/selumetinib). In contrast, the established metastatic melanoma cell line, WM239A, showed a strong apoptotic response, induced by inhibitor. Microarray expression profiling was carried out on MB947P and WM239A cells in the presence and absence of drug. The results showed that in MB947P cells inhibitor-dependent induction of Bim was minimal. In contrast, Bim was strongly induced by inhibitor in WM239A cells, where siRNA knockdown of Bim demonstrated its requirement for the apoptotic response. This suggests that the lack of apoptotic response in MB947P cells may be caused by a block in Bim induction through an unknown mechanism. Finally, co-culture of MB947P and WM239A cells showed partial inhibition of the apoptotic response in WM239A cells after AZD6244 treatment. This suggests the potential existence of a soluble factor in MB947P cells that confers resistance to apoptosis in WM239A cells. We propose that mechanisms for resistance to apoptosis in direct in vivo xenograft cell lines may ultimately inform mechanisms for resistance in patient tumors.

      "Full Abstract: Background:The female genital tract is an uncommon site of involvement for extragenital malignancies. Ovarian, vaginal, and cervical metastasis has been described in the literature. Uterine corpus and, particularly, endometrial involvement are exceedingly rare. As the incidence of lung cancer is rising in the female population, metastatic uterine involvement by lung cancer is also being reported in the medical literature. Here, we report two cases of endometrial metastasis from primary lung adenocarcinoma. Case Report:The first case is a 55-year-old woman diagnosed with stage III lung adenocarcinoma who received initial treatment with sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which resulted in complete response to treatment. However, patient was found to have recurrence soon after completion of initial treatment. Biopsy of a hypermetabolic lesion confirmed endometrial metastasis. The second case is a 51-year-old woman who presented with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with metastasis to the uterus. EGFR mutation analysis of the lung mass and endometrial biopsy revealed epidermal growth factor receptor L858R mutation in exon 21. She had a positive response to EGFR-directed treatment of all areas of disease, including the uterus. Conclusions:Uterine metastasis from lung adenocarcinoma is uncommon and difficult to differentiate from primary uterine cancer. The possibility of lung cancer metastasis should be considered in patients who have adenocarcinoma on biopsy of uterine lesions.\n",

      "Full Abstract: The incidence of malignant melanoma has been on the rise for the past 30 years with a lifetime risk of 1 in 75. In its early stage, melanoma is easily cured, but the prognosis associated with metastatic malignant melanoma remains very poor and is one of the most treatment-refractory malignancies. FDA-approved melanoma therapeutics, Dacarbazine (DTIC) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) are associated with response rates of only 10-20% and do not yield long-lasting remissions. A direct and selective p53-independent cancer therapy is the application of Tumor necrosis factor-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand (TRAIL). TRAIL can induce apoptosis in a broad range of transformed human cells while showing minimal toxicity towards non-malignant cells. However, some cancers are resistant to rhTRAIL-induced apoptosis as a direct result of overexpressed antiapoptotic proteins. One key driver mediating the expression of such antiapoptotic proteins is Casein Kinase 2 (CK2). Upregulated in the nucleus of all cancer cells, CK2 serves as an oncoprotein, promoting the expression of inhibitors of apoptosis resulting in resistance to cell death. By inhibiting CK2 and, therefore, downregulating its antiapoptotic products, TRAIL-resistant cells may become more sensitive to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. To date, Ellagic Acid (EA) is the most potent, naturally-occurring CK2 inhibitor, possessing a Ki of 20 nM. To test whether the addition of EA could sensitize cancer cells to the effects of TRAIL, we utilized cotreatment with TRAIL and EA against the V600E BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines A375 and WM164, which have previously been reported as TRAIL-resistant. Our in vitro analyses showed that the cotreatment of TRAIL plus EA does not augment the ability of TRAIL to induce apoptosis in A375 as determined by Annexin-V Apoptosis assays and Western Blot analysis. TRAIL-alone was able to induce apoptosis in A375 characterized by the formation of Annexin-V positive cells, PARP fragmentation and the activation of caspase 3. TRAIL initiated both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis marked by caspase 8-activation and the mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, respectively. However, EA treatment alone did not induce apoptosis marked by the absence of Annexin-V positive cells and PARP fragmentation. Additionally, both TRAIL and EA, as single-agents, inhibited the growth of A375 in a dose-dependent manner, and the combination treatment of TRAIL plus EA enhanced the cytostatic effects of the single-agent treatments as determined by Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) colorimetric assays. Cell cycle analysis through Propidium Iodide (PI) staining and FACS analysis revealed that EA impeded cell growth through an EA-mediated S-phase arrest in A375. Microarray analysis showed that EA downregulates antiapoptotic proteins survivin, XIAP, cIAP-2 and cIAP-1 and upregulates the death receptor DR5. In vivo, we showed that the combination treatment of TRAIL plus EA did not potentiate the ability of TRAIL to inhibit the growth of established A375 tumors. TRAIL alone inhibited tumor growth by 80% and H&E staining of TRAIL-treated tumors presented evidence of apoptotic cells. EA was not able to stop the growth of established A375 tumors and did not augment the in vivo antiproliferative effects of TRAIL. Lastly, we showed that TRAIL is cytotoxic towards WM164 cells and can reduce the viability of A375 as determined by Trypan Blue exclusion assays. Whereas EA, although it can inhibit the growth of WM164, does not reduce the viability of the cells. Additional analysis of the potential of EA to sensitize WM164 to the effects of TRAIL is ongoing. These data demonstrate that EA can enhance the cytostatic but not the cytotoxic or proapoptotic effects of TRAIL in vitro. In vivo, TRAIL can inhibit the growth of established tumors as a single-agent but is not augmented by cotreatment with EA. Citation Format: Katherine A. Turner, Daniel Lindner, Michael Kalafatis.

      "Full Abstract: V600 mutations of BRAF are present in 40% of cutaneous melanoma and are currently targeted for therapy by specific inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib). While BRAFV600 mutations are mostly heterozygous, the impact of BRAF mutated allelic specific imbalance (MASI) on the sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors and on clinical outcome has not been evaluated so far. Here we compared cell proliferation, tumor growth and vemurafenib sensitivity of heterozygous versus homozygous BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cell lines. We also performed a retrospective study evaluating the impact on overall survival and drug response of BRAF V600E mutated melanoma patients with or without MASI. Methods: We conducted proliferation and cytotoxity assays to compare cell growth and sensitivity to vemurafenib and trametinib in heterozygous, versus homozygous BRAF V600 mutated human melanoma cell lines. Their in vivo tumorigenesis and sensitivity to vemurafenib was also evaluated upon engraftment in SCID mice. A retrospective series of 179 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF V600 mutations were analyzed and early first line treatment response was compared between patients with or without MASI. Results: Our results showed that heterozygous BRAF V600 mutated melanoma cell lines proliferate less rapidly than homozygous cell lines in vitro (cell proliferation counts after 7 days range from 3.6 x106 to 7.7x106 cells for homozygote cells, and from 4.8x104 to 5.5x105 for heterozygous cell lines) and in vivo (palpable tumors appeared on average 7 days after inoculation for homozygous cells but after 39 days for heterozygous cells). Heterozygous cell lines are more resistant to BRAF inhibitors either in vitro or in vivo (IC50 of vemurafenib ranged from 0,1 to 0,198 M for homozygous cells and from 8,62 to 22,65 M for heterozygous cell lines). We have also shown that patients with BRAF V600 mutated tumors with MASI may have initially a poorer prognosis (median overall survival 733 days IC95% [381; 1762] versus 1011 days IC95%[879;2969] p=0.236) but tend to have better responses to systemic drugs than patients without MASI (percentage of primary resistance 23% versus 34%; p=0.56). In conclusion: This translational study shows that a MASI of BRAF in melanoma is associated with a higher cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential in vitro and in vivo. This mutational status is also associated with a better response to BRAF inhibitor in vitro and in mice xenografts. Clinical relevance of these data should be more thoroughly evaluated on larger and more homogeneous series of patients however our preliminary data show a trend toward a clinical-experimental correlation with similar yet still statistically insignificant results. If confirmed, our data suggest that study of the MASI of BRAF mutation could serve as a predictive marker of patient response to vemurafenib. The role of paradoxical activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in cells without MASI of BRAF needs to be further explored.

      "Full Abstract: V600 mutations of BRAF are present in 40% of cutaneous melanoma and are currently targeted for therapy by specific inhibitors (vemurafenib, dabrafenib). While BRAFV600 mutations are mostly heterozygous, the impact of BRAF mutated allelic specific imbalance (MASI) on the sensitivity to BRAF inhibitors and on clinical outcome has not been evaluated so far. Here we compared cell proliferation, tumor growth and vemurafenib sensitivity of heterozygous versus homozygous BRAF V600E mutated melanoma cell lines. We also performed a retrospective study evaluating the impact on overall survival and drug response of BRAF V600E mutated melanoma patients with or without MASI. Methods: We conducted proliferation and cytotoxity assays to compare cell growth and sensitivity to vemurafenib and trametinib in heterozygous, versus homozygous BRAF V600 mutated human melanoma cell lines. Their in vivo tumorigenesis and sensitivity to vemurafenib was also evaluated upon engraftment in SCID mice. A retrospective series of 179 patients with metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF V600 mutations were analyzed and early first line treatment response was compared between patients with or without MASI. Results: Our results showed that heterozygous BRAF V600 mutated melanoma cell lines proliferate less rapidly than homozygous cell lines in vitro (cell proliferation counts after 7 days range from 3.6 x106 to 7.7x106 cells for homozygote cells, and from 4.8x104 to 5.5x105 for heterozygous cell lines) and in vivo (palpable tumors appeared on average 7 days after inoculation for homozygous cells but after 39 days for heterozygous cells). Heterozygous cell lines are more resistant to BRAF inhibitors either in vitro or in vivo (IC50 of vemurafenib ranged from 0,1 to 0,198 M for homozygous cells and from 8,62 to 22,65 M for heterozygous cell lines). We have also shown that patients with BRAF V600 mutated tumors with MASI may have initially a poorer prognosis (median overall survival 733 days IC95% [381; 1762] versus 1011 days IC95%[879;2969] p=0.236) but tend to have better responses to systemic drugs than patients without MASI (percentage of primary resistance 23% versus 34%; p=0.56). In conclusion: This translational study shows that a MASI of BRAF in melanoma is associated with a higher cell proliferation and tumorigenic potential in vitro and in vivo. This mutational status is also associated with a better response to BRAF inhibitor in vitro and in mice xenografts. Clinical relevance of these data should be more thoroughly evaluated on larger and more homogeneous series of patients however our preliminary data show a trend toward a clinical-experimental correlation with similar yet still statistically insignificant results. If confirmed, our data suggest that study of the MASI of BRAF mutation could serve as a predictive marker of patient response to vemurafenib. The role of paradoxical activation of the MAPK signaling pathway in cells without MASI of BRAF needs to be further explored.

      "Full Abstract: Androgen receptor (AR) mutations have been described to emerge in response to prostate cancer treatment with first generation AR antagonists, resulting in broadened ligand specificity and AR antagonist-to-agonist switch. Second-generation AR antagonists enzalutamide and ARN-509 function as antagonists in the presence of AR overexpression. They express high clinical efficacy in castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) but eventually resistance will emerge. Recently, a F876L missense mutation in the ligand-binding domain of AR has been described that confers resistance to enzalutamide and ARN-509 in preclinical models of prostate cancer. AR F876L mutation has also been identified in plasma DNA from ARN-509-treated CRPC patients with rising PSA. ODM-201 is a new generation AR inhibitor with high anticancer activity in patients with CRPC and has unique properties compared to first and second generation antiandrogens. ODM-201 and its major metabolite bind to wt AR with excellent affinity (Ki 8 and 9 nM, respectively) and selectivity. In functional cell-based assays, ODM-201 functions as antagonist in highly AR overexpressing cells and does not induce AR T877A or W741L transcriptional activity. In contrast to enzalutamide and ARN-509, ODM-201 and its metabolite have been found to potently inhibit the activity of AR F876L while enzalutamide and ARN-509 were agonistic. ODM-201 is a promising new generation AR inhibitor for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer with superior antiandrogenic activity in preclinical models of AR function.

      "Full Abstract: KDR, also known as VEGFR2, is a target of several VEGFR inhibitors, however, only bevacizumab, which targets the VEGF ligand, is FDA approved for lung cancer. Since an activating mutation in KDR was identified in 70% of lung adenocarcinoma patients we sought to identify the number of available clinical trials targeting KDR in lung adenocarcinomas and/or solid tumors, thereby increasing therapeutic options and treatment accessibility for these patients. DNA from thirteen lung cancer FFPE samples was sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 or MiSeq sequencers using a CLIA-certified 358-gene targeted sequencing assay. FASTQ files generated from Illumina's CASAVA software were submitted to a Clinical Genome Analytics (CGA) data analysis pipeline to perform automated read quality assessment, alignment, and variant calling. Clinical reports were written for each sample through extensive literature and clinicaltrials.gov searches. Thirteen lung biopsies were obtained and subdivided based on pathology reports, into 10 lung adenocarcinomas, 1 mixed NSCLC/SCLC, 1 small cell carcinoma, and 1 squamous carcinoma. KDR Q472H was identified in 7/10 lung adenocarcinomas and 1/1 mixed NSCLC/SCLC, but not in the small or squamous cell carcinomas. KDR encodes Vegfr-2, a receptor tyrosine kinase overexpressed in a variety of solid tumors. KDR Q472H is an activating missense mutation, which increases phosphorylation and activation of Vegfr-2, thereby promoting increased microvessel density in lung tumor tissues. At the time of clinical report writing, there were a total of 47 actively recruiting clinical trials targeting KDR and 4 trials requiring the patient to have a molecular alteration of KDR. Further breakdown of these trials identified the use of 33 off-label VEGFR inhibitors, 5 investigational pan-VEGFR inhibitors, and 5 investigational specific KDR (VEGFR2) inhibitors. Next-generation sequencing of 358 genes from lung cancer biopsies identified a common KDR activating mutation, Q472H, in 70% of lung adenocarcinomas. Searching clincialtrials.gov by pan-VEGFR and specific KDR inhibitors identified 47 actively recruiting trials, thus increasing the accessible repertoire of treatment options for lung adenocarcinoma patients.

      "Full Abstract: The genetic event associated to the initiation process of hepatocarcinogenesis has not been well elucidated. By whole-exome analysis, we identified BrafV637E mutation, which is equivalent to human BrafV600E mutation, in all the four DEN-induced mouse hepatic tumors examined. By Sanger sequencing we validated that the BrafV637E mutation is highly frequent in the hepatic tumors [17/18 (94.4%)] in 1 year-old DEN-treated mice. Using DNA isolated by microscopic dissection we detected the BrafV637E mutation in 14/16 (87.5%) and 7/9 (77.8%) small preneoplastic hepatocyte foci respectively at 5 and 8 months after DEN treatment, indicating that the BrafV637E mutation occurs in the early stage. On the other hand, although the BrafV637E mutation was frequent in hepatic tumors induced by neonatal DEN treatment followed by weekly-administration of CCl4 [5/7 (71.4%)], none of 6 spontaneous and 24 CCl4-induced liver tumors showed the BrafV637E mutation, indicating that the BrafV637E mutation is specific for DEN-induced tumors. Histological analysis revealed that BrafV637E mutation was quite common in the lesions consisted of basophilic cells, while it was much less frequent in the lesions consisted of eosinophilic cells. We then investigated how the BrafV637E mutation influences the properties of preneoplastic/neoplastic hepatocytes. Firstly, the qPCR analysis revealed that p15Ink4b and p19ARF were upregulated in the DEN-induced hepatic tumors as compared to the surrounding non-tumor tissues, indicating that the Braf mutation leads to oncogene induced senescence (OIS), which may be related to the dormancy of preneoplastic lesions in the early stage. Secondly, when investigated the intracellular signaling pathways, Akt phosphorylation was much increased in the hepatic tumors as compared to the surrounding hepatic tissue, while ERK1/2 phosphorylation was not increased, suggesting the possible link between BrafV637E mutation and Akt activation. Thirdly, vemurafenib suppressed proliferation of the BrafV637E-mutated liver tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo, but not the proliferation of the BrafV637E mutation negative cells, indicating that BrafV637E mutation is related to the growth capacity. In summary, our results demonstrated that BrafV637E mutation is an early event in DEN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis, and may be related both to growth suppression via OIS and proliferation through activation of intracellular signaling.

      "Full Abstract: Background Among 493 patients with early stage, lower risk (70% node negative), HER2 positive breast cancer, the 2-year DFS was 97% with adjuvant docetaxel and cyclophosphamide plus 1 year of trastuzumab (TCH) in a phase 2 study (Jones et al, Lancet Oncology 14: 1121, 2013). The objective of this work was to investigate the presence of ERBB2 specific DNA biomarkers in HER2 amplified tumors associated with relapse compared to those which did not recur during 3 years of followup. Methods The 26 coding exons of the ERBB2 gene were analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) on the HiSeq-2500 (Illumina) platform using DNA samples from the primary tumors of 13 of the 493 patients who progressed. Treatment refractory cases were analyzed in parallel with a clinically and pathologically matched group of 11 patients from the same trial with 2-year relapse free survival (RFS). Results ERBB2 gene variants were detected in all 11 relapse-free patients and 10/13 patients with relapse. Heterogeneity for sub-clonal ERBB2 variants at 30 ERBB2 SNVs. These sub-clonal ERBB2 SNVs were not detected in a comparison set of non-HER2 positive solid tumors. We did find variants that seem to be associated with later relapse, of which one is statistically significant (I655V; p=1.2%, Fisher exact test, no compensation for multiple testing), and further 5 have p 75%, hence suggesting homozygous germline presence) are exclusively found in the no-relapse group (p=3.1%). These biomarkers in combination with other molecular studies including immune function gene status may help define the subset of patients at risk for relapse during TCH therapy. The hyper-mutability genotype does not seem to correlate with later relapse, so it may be hypothized that the low TVF mutations are passengers rather than drivers. Further studies are needed to verify and precisely define the role of these ERBB2 biomarkers in HER2 positive breast cancer.

These biomarkers in combination with other molecular studies including immune function gene status may help define the subset of patients at risk for relapse during TCH therapy. The hyper-mutability genotype does not seem to correlate with later relapse, so it may be hypothized that the low TVF mutations are passengers rather than drivers. Further studies are needed to verify and precisely define the role of these ERBB2 biomarkers in HER2 positive breast cancer.

      "Full Abstract: Current EGFR/c-Met tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) combination therapies are shown to be susceptible to acquired resistance in the majority of NSCLC patients. To understand how cells develop EGFR/c-Met TKI resistance, we use three model NSCLC cell lines: H2170, H358 and H1975. H2170 and H358 cell lines express high levels of EGFR and c-Met and are EGFR wild-type. These cell lines were made resistant to the EGFR TKI erlotinib, the c-Met TKI SU11274 and a combination of both by exposure to increasing concentrations of these TKIs. The H1975 cell line is positive for two EGFR TKD mutations (T790M and L858R) which confer resistance to erlotinib. Studies have shown that EGFR/c-Met TKI resistant cells may use alternative signaling pathways to activate downstream transcription/translation proteins previously activated by EGFR and c-Met signaling. The Wnt/-catenin and mTOR pathways are demonstrated to have significant roles in cell survival, resistance and tumorigenesis in NSCLC. Several EGFR/c-Met-linked proteins in these two signaling pathways were differentially modulated in H2170 and H358 resistant lines. The Wnt signaling transducer -catenin plays a role in cellular proliferation and death and its deregulation is implicated in lung cancer. Protein kinase GSK-3 also plays an important role in lung cancer and its inhibition by Wnt results in mTOR activation. It is encoded by two genes, GSK-3 and GSK-3. GATA-6 is a transcriptional activator of Wnt and is also implicated in several cancers. Active -catenin was found to be 2 to 4-fold upreglated in H2170 SU11274-resistant (SR) cells and 2 to 20-fold upreglated in H2170 erlotinib-resistant (ER) cells, in the presence and absence of TKIs and growth factor ligands, when compared to nave H2170 cells. GATA-6 was found to be 1.5 to 4-fold upreglated in H2170 SR cells and 2 to 3-fold upreglated in H2170 ER cells. Conversely, p-GSK-3 and p-GSK-3 were found to be 1.2 to 4.8-fold and 1.5 to 10.7-fold downreglated in H2170 SR cells, respectively. These results indicate increased activation of the Wnt/-catenin and mTOR pathways in TKI resistant cells. We are currently studying the expression of these proteins further in the H1975 cell line. To translate our studies to patients, we are investigating the role of EGFR/c-Met synergism in NSCLC by conducting a retrospective biomarker analysis using IHC on 100 tissue samples from patients with stage 3 and 4 squamous cell and adenocarcinoma. Preliminary results indicate that EGFR and c-Met receptors are co-expressed in lung cancer tissues and we are acquiring data to determine how co-localization and synergism affects patient prognosis. Further studies are being conducted on proteins in the Wnt and mTOR signaling pathways, such as p70S6Kinase, mTOR, -Catenin and Axin-2, and their involvement in patient prognosis and resistance. This study may provide clinicians with novel targets for improving treatment options for future NSCLC patients.

      "Full Abstract: Background: Although the spectrum of genomic alterations in primary, treatment-nave breast tumors has been described, the genomic landscape of HER2+ MBC remains underexplored. Furthermore, tumor genomic alterations that arise after progression on anti-HER2 therapy are largely unknown. Methods: We prospectively collected metastatic tumor biopsies from patients (pts) enrolled on TBCRC003 (NCT00470704), a phase II study evaluating the combination of lapatinib (L) and T in pts with HER2+ MBC who had varying degrees of prior T exposure. We performed WES on baseline metastatic biopsies and normal DNA from 57 pts. In 36 pts, we also performed WES on pre-treatment primary tumors. Tumors were analyzed for point mutations, insertions/deletions, and copy number alterations. Results: Total accrual was 116 pts. 87 pts were registered in one of two efficacy cohorts: Cohort 1 included pts w no prior T for MBC. Pts with prior adjuvant T were included if the interval from last T to 1st recurrence > 12 months. Cohort 2 included pts with 1-2 prior lines of T for MBC or recurrence within 12 months of adjuvant T. An additional 29 pts were enrolled in a biomarker cohort (Cohort 3). Per-protocol efficacy analyses for 85 pts deemed evaluable are shown below: Objective Response RateClinical Benefit RateMedian Time to ProgressionCohort 150% (90% CI 33.8-66.2%)57.5% (95% CI 40.9-73.0)7.4 monthsCohort 222.2% (90% CI 11.2-37.1%)42.2% (95% CI 27.7-57.8)5.3 months As we previously reported (Wagle et al, ASCO 2014), across 57 metastatic tumors, significant recurrently mutated genes were TP53 (n=30; 53%) and PIK3CA (n=19; 33%). The frequency of mutant TP53 and PIK3CA was not significantly different from 119 primary, treatment-nave HER2+ tumors sequenced in the TCGA study (50%, p=0.8 and 27%, p=0.5, respectively). Recurrent copy number alterations were also similar to TCGA data. Comparing the 38 pts who received any prior T with the 19 pts who did not, there was no significant difference in the incidence of mutant TP53 (53% vs 53%, p=1.0) and PIK3CA (37% vs 26%, p=0.6). We identified mutations in the HER2 kinase domain in 4/38 pts who received prior T (11%), as compared to 0/19 T-nave pts. HER2 kinase domain mutations have been identified in 2% of HER2-negative cancers but <1% of primary HER2+ cancers. 3 of the mutations were L755S, which has been shown to be resistant to L and sensitive to irreversible HER2 inhibitors. The 4th mutation was D742N, a novel kinase domain mutation. None of the 4 pts with HER2 kinase domain mutations had an objective response, though 1 pt had stable disease for 29 weeks. An analysis comparing paired archival primary tumors and baseline metastatic biopsies from 36 pts to identify genomic alterations acquired or enriched in the metastatic tumors will be presented. Conclusions: We present an analysis of the genomic landscape of HER2+ MBC, including comparisons between matched primary tumors and metastatic biopsies. Somatic HER2 kinase mutations in pts with HER2+ MBC treated with prior T suggests that these mutations may be involved in resistance to T, and may predict poor response to additional anti-HER2 therapy with combined L and T. Novel therapeutic approaches may be required for these pts.

      "Full Abstract: Activating mutations of the ALK (Anaplastic lymphoma Kinase) gene have been identified in sporadic and familial cases of neuroblastoma, a cancer of early childhood arising from the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). To decipher ALK function in neuroblastoma predisposition and oncogenesis, we have characterized knock-in (KI) mice bearing the two most frequent mutations observed in neuroblastoma patients. A dramatic enlargement of sympathetic ganglia is observed in Alk F1178L mice from embryonic to adult stages associated with an increased proliferation of sympathetic neuroblasts from E14.5 to birth. In a MYCN transgenic context, the F1178L mutation displays a higher oncogenic potential than the R1279Q mutation as evident from a shorter latency of tumor onset. We show that tumors expressing the R1279Q mutation are sensitive to ALK inhibition upon crizotinib treatment. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that activated ALK triggers RET upregulation in mouse sympathetic ganglia at birth as well as in murine and human neuroblastoma. Using vandetanib, we show that RET inhibition strongly impairs tumor growth in vivo in both MYCN /KI Alk R1279Q and MYCN /KI Alk F1178L mice. Altogether, our findings demonstrate the critical role of activated ALK in SNS development and pathogenesis and identify RET as a therapeutic target in ALK mutated neuroblastoma.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Senescence is a cytostatic cell fate that can be induced by oncogene activation, replicative stress or therapy-induced stress. Therapy-induced senescence (TIS) of tumor cells can be initiated by anti-cancer compounds or radiation. TIS is generally considered to be irreversible, and as such this process is believed to be a desirable therapeutic outcome. In this study, we show that melanomas characterized by high levels of the signaling molecule Wnt5A respond to irradiation by undergoing growth arrest, and by expressing classical markers of senescence, including positivity for senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA--gal), senescence associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF), H3K9Me chromatin marks, and PML bodies. Even though these cells are positive for classical markers of senescence, we find that they retain their ability to migrate and invade. Further, these Wnt5A-high cells are able to proliferate following metastasis and form new tumors in the lung, while expressing increased markers of senescence. Silencing Wnt5A reduces expression of these senescence markers and decreases invasiveness. Finally, Wnt5A-high melanoma cells treated with PLX4720, a BRAFV600E targeted therapy, also increase markers of a TIS response, while remaining invasive. The combined data challenge the paradigm that TIS is a desirable therapeutic endpoint. They also point to Wnt5A as a master regulator of this senescence-like stress-induced phenotype in melanoma.

      "Full Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are heterogeneous tumors that are refractory to radiation and traditional chemotherapeutics. Separate studies have identified populations of neural stem and progenitor -like GBM cells, however the contribution of these cells types to tumor progression and the response to targeted therapy are poorly understood. Small molecules (such as vemurafenib) targeting the most common MAPK-activating mutation, BRAFV600E, are currently entering clinical trials for treatment of high-grade glioma. Understanding the contribution of different cell types to treatment responses will be necessary for the design of effective adjuvant therapeutic strategies. We show that activating MAPK pathway gene mutations in GBM correlate with elevated expression levels of oligodendrocyte precursor (OPC) and neural stem cell (NSC)-associated genes. Cells expressing CD133 and NG2 coexist in human GBM and BRafV600E expressing mouse neurosphere cultures, and maintain some of their respective neural stem and progenitor-like properties. In isogenic mouse cells expressing BRafV600E, NG2+ cells expand rapidly and symmetrically, while rates of asymmetric division are unaffected in slow-proliferating CD133+ cells. Tracing of proliferation rate with the membrane-associated dye PKH-26 reveals heterogeneity in the proliferation rate of CD133+ cells, but not proliferative NG2+ cells. BRAF-targeted inhibition of human GBM cells with PLX4720, the tool compound of vemurafenib, reduces S-phase entry of NG2+ cells, yet CD133+ cells are less affected. Interestingly targeted inhibition of components of the asymmetric division machinery selectively disrupts G2-M progression in CD133+ cells. The functionally divergent populations of CD133-expressing NSC-like cells will likely be therapeutically problematic with mono-therapeutic approaches. These data point to a differential regulation of key cell cycle processes between CD133+ stem-like cells and NG2+ OPC-like cells, that will inform the intelligent design of compound treatment strategies.

      "Full Abstract: Background: EGFR kinase inhibitors, including erlotinib, are effective treatments for patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer. However, resistance inevitably develops, most commonly (60%) mediated by an EGFR secondary mutation EGFR T790M. Mutant selective EGFR inhibitors (WZ4002, AZD9291, CO-1686) are effective in preclinical models and clinically (AZD9291 & CO-1686) in EGFR T790M patients (response rates (RR) > 50%) but are less effective in patients with non-T790M mediated drug resistance (AZD9291 RR 10%). Combination of afatinib and cetuximab is effective in both T790M (32% RR) and non-T790M (25% RR) mediated resistance but is associated with significant toxicity. We evaluated whether cetuximab could add to the efficacy of a mutant selective EGFR inhibitor and whether the combination was also effective in a model of non-T790M mediated resistance. Methods: Mice harboring xenografts from PC9GR (EGFR Del 19/T790M), H1975 (EGFR L858R/T790M), HCC827GR (EGFR Del 19/MET amplification) cells or genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMS) expressing EGFR L858R/T790M were treated with vehicle, WZ4002 alone, cetuximab alone or the combination. We compared the efficacy of the treatments and evaluated for tumor cures (defined as tumor disappearance and lack of regrowth following 6 weeks of drug withdrawal). In addition, we evaluated the impact of the treatments on EGFR signaling and apoptosis. Results: In the EGFR T790M xenograft models (PC9GR and H1975), the combination of WZ4002 and cetuximab was more effective than either single agent. Only the combination led to tumor cures (5/15 in PC9GR and 3/18 in H1975) while none were observed with the single agents. In the HCC827GR xenografts, the combination of WZ4002/cetuximab was more effective than the single agents but did not lead to any cures. Evaluation of the tumors from treated mice revealed that the efficacy of the combination correlates with effective degradation of EGFR and MET (in HCC827GR). In the L858R/T790M GEMMs, the combination led to significantly greater tumor shrinkage compared to single agents. Evaluation of treated tumors revealed enhanced apoptosis in the combination treated mice. Conclusions: The addition of cetuximab enhances the efficacy of the mutant selective EGFR inhibitor WZ4002 in vivo by increasing the single agent efficacy in both EGFR T790M and non-T790M models.

      "Full Abstract: Background: EGFR kinase inhibitors, including erlotinib, are effective treatments for patients with EGFR mutant lung cancer. However, resistance inevitably develops, most commonly (60%) mediated by an EGFR secondary mutation EGFR T790M. Mutant selective EGFR inhibitors (WZ4002, AZD9291, CO-1686) are effective in preclinical models and clinically (AZD9291 & CO-1686) in EGFR T790M patients (response rates (RR) > 50%) but are less effective in patients with non-T790M mediated drug resistance (AZD9291 RR 10%). Combination of afatinib and cetuximab is effective in both T790M (32% RR) and non-T790M (25% RR) mediated resistance but is associated with significant toxicity. We evaluated whether cetuximab could add to the efficacy of a mutant selective EGFR inhibitor and whether the combination was also effective in a model of non-T790M mediated resistance. Methods: Mice harboring xenografts from PC9GR (EGFR Del 19/T790M), H1975 (EGFR L858R/T790M), HCC827GR (EGFR Del 19/MET amplification) cells or genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMS) expressing EGFR L858R/T790M were treated with vehicle, WZ4002 alone, cetuximab alone or the combination. We compared the efficacy of the treatments and evaluated for tumor cures (defined as tumor disappearance and lack of regrowth following 6 weeks of drug withdrawal). In addition, we evaluated the impact of the treatments on EGFR signaling and apoptosis. Results: In the EGFR T790M xenograft models (PC9GR and H1975), the combination of WZ4002 and cetuximab was more effective than either single agent. Only the combination led to tumor cures (5/15 in PC9GR and 3/18 in H1975) while none were observed with the single agents. In the HCC827GR xenografts, the combination of WZ4002/cetuximab was more effective than the single agents but did not lead to any cures. Evaluation of the tumors from treated mice revealed that the efficacy of the combination correlates with effective degradation of EGFR and MET (in HCC827GR). In the L858R/T790M GEMMs, the combination led to significantly greater tumor shrinkage compared to single agents. Evaluation of treated tumors revealed enhanced apoptosis in the combination treated mice. Conclusions: The addition of cetuximab enhances the efficacy of the mutant selective EGFR inhibitor WZ4002 in vivo by increasing the single agent efficacy in both EGFR T790M and non-T790M models.

      "Full Abstract: Background: Ipilimumab (IPI; anti-CTLA4) and pembrolizumab (PEMBRO; anti-PD-1) are checkpoint inhibitors that stimulate immune responses to cancer. In KEYNOTE-001, PEMBRO showed durable antitumor activity in melanoma patients (pts), regardless of prior IPI treatment. KEYNOTE-006 (NCT01866319) is a pivotal phase III study comparing IPI with 2 PEMBRO dosing regimens in IPI-naive (IPI-N) advanced melanoma pts. Methods: Pts were randomized 1:1:1 to PEMBRO 10 mg/kg Q2W, PEMBRO 10 mg/kg Q3W, or 4 doses of IPI 3 mg/kg Q3W. Randomization was stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs 1), line of therapy (first vs second), and PD-L1 expression (positive [staining in 1% of tumor cells] vs negative). BRAFV600-mutant pts naive to BRAF inhibitors were eligible if LDH was normal and there was no evidence of tumor-related symptoms or rapidly progressing disease. PEMBRO was continued until progression, intolerable toxicity, or 24 months. Response was assessed at wk 12 and every 6 wk thereafter per RECIST v1.1 by central review (primary for efficacy) and per immune-related response criteria by investigator review (primary for therapy management). Primary end points are PFS and OS. Secondary end points include ORR and safety. Primary objective of the first interim analysis (IA1), which occurred after completion of enrollment, was to evaluate the superiority of either PEMBRO schedule over IPI for PFS at a 1-sided = 0.002. IA1 was to be performed when 260 PFS events occurred across all arms and all pts had 6 mo of follow-up. Differences in PFS and OS were assessed by a stratified log-rank test. Data cutoff date was Sep 3, 2014. The final OS analysis will be performed as the data matures. Results: 834 pts from 16 countries were enrolled between Sep 2013 and Mar 2014; 66% were treatment naive, 80% were PD-L1+, 36% were BRAFV600 mutant, and 69% had ECOG PS 0. Based on 502 PFS events (central RECIST v1.1), both PEMBRO doses demonstrated superiority over IPI (HR 0.58, P .AM2015-CT101\n",

      "Full Abstract: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation have benefited from treatment of reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib. Acquisition of a secondary mutation in EGFR T790M is the most common mechanism of resistance to first generation EGFR TKIs, resulting in therapeutic failure. Afatinib is a second generation of EGFR TKI that showed great efficacy against tumors bearing the EGFR T790M mutation, but it failed to show the improvement on overall survival of lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations possibly because of novel acquired resistance mechanisms. Currently, there are no therapeutic options available for lung cancer patients who develop acquired resistance to afatinib. To identify novel resistance mechanism(s) to afatinib, we developed afatinib resistant cell lines from a parental human-derived NSCLC cell line, H1975, harboring both EGFR L858R and T790M mutations. We found that activation of the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) signaling pathway contributes to afatinib resistance in NSCLC cells harboring the T790M mutation. IGF1R knockdown not only significantly sensitizes resistant cells to afatinib, but also induces apoptosis in afatinib resistance cells. In addition, combination treatment with afatinib and linsitinib shows more than additive effects on tumor growth in in vivo H1975 xenograft. Therefore, these finding suggest that IGF1R inhibition or combination of EGFR-IGF1R inhibition strategies would be potential ways to prevent or potentiate the effects of current therapeutic options to lung cancer patients demonstrating resistance to either first or second generation EGFR TKIs. 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Thyroid cancer is increasingly common in the United States. Although prognosis is generally very good, thyroid cancer has a high recurrence rate and there are limited treatment options available for advanced metastatic disease. Since genetic mutations causing over-activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway are found in over 70% of papillary thyroid cancers, molecular inhibitors targeting these kinases are promising therapeutics. A multikinase inhibitor, Sorafenib, was recently FDA-approved for treatment of advanced thyroid cancer as it significantly increased progression-free survival time. To build upon this success, improvement in efficacy and reduction in common side effects may be possible through more targeted approaches. The most common specific mutation to target is BRAFV600E which occurs in 50% of papillary thyroid cancers and 25% of anaplastic thyroid cancers. BRAFV600E is correlated with advanced stage, lymph node metastasis, extrathyroidal extension, resistance to traditional therapy, and cancer-related mortality in papillary thyroid cancer. PLX4032 (Vemurafenib) is a specific kinase inhibitor developed to halt BRAFV600E-mediated excessive activation of the MAPK pathway. BRAFV600E-positive malignant melanoma patients treated with PLX4032 often experience astounding tumor regression followed by development of drug resistance, which is thought to be acquired through signaling via alternative molecules, bypassing the need for BRAFV600E kinase activity. We hypothesized that treatment with PLX4032 would inhibit MAPK signaling and promote an anti-proliferative phenotype in thyroid cancer cell lines harboring BRAFV600E, without having these effects on BRAF-wildtype cells. In BRAF-mutated cells, we also predicted that certain signaling molecules could become activated to circumvent the PLX4032-mediated inhibition, as seen in melanoma. Results demonstrate that PLX4032 inhibits proliferation, causes apoptosis, and arrests cell cycle selectively in BRAFV600E-positive thyroid cells. These phenotypic responses corresponded to diminished phosphorylation of central signaling proteins downstream of BRAF, including MEK, ERK, and mTOR. The mutated papillary thyroid cancer cells express both MAP3K8 (COT) and CRAF, kinases capable of growth-promoting signaling independent of BRAFV600E, in the face of PLX4032 treatment over time. These results indicate that targeted inhibition of BRAFV600E creates powerful anti-tumor effects in thyroid cancer cells, although mechanisms of resistance similar to those seen in melanoma patients may also occur. Detailed investigation into cell signaling pathways that contribute to thyroid cancer progression will allow for more effective combinational targeted molecular therapy and limit development of drug resistance to specific inhibitors such as PLX4032.

      "Full Abstract: Primary cartilaginous tumors often arise from endochondral ossification, range from benign endochondroma and osteochondroma to malignant chondrosarcoma, and are notoriously resistant to chemotherapy or radiation. This urges development of novel therapeutic approaches particularly in chondrosarcoma, which is a terminal disease in more than 90% of unresectable cases [1]. Now research of Zhou and colleagues [2] suggests an intriguing possibility that activation of mechanisms that naturally restrict the skeletal development may have a therapeutic potential in chondrosarcoma. Authors show that chondrocyte-specific deletion of gene encoding fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (Fgfr3) induces multiple tumor lesions adjacent to growth plate cartilage in mice. These lesions are characteristic of endochondromas and osteochondromas, and show elevated expression of chondrocyte mitogen and morphogen, the indian hedgehog (IHH). Chemical inhibition of IHH signaling ameliorated endochondroma development, demonstrating that FGFR3 acts as a cartilage tumor suppressor which exerts its function via negative control of IHH production [2]. FGFR3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase which transduces the extracellular communication signals delivered by members of FGF family of growth factors. In its major physiological function, the FGFR3 acts as a brake on bone growth, as proven by skeletal overgrowth in Fgfr3 null mice, or in human camptodactyly, tall stature, and hearing loss (CATSHL) syndrome, caused by loss-of-function mutations in FGFR3. On the other hand, germline activating mutations in FGFR3 trigger profound inhibition of chondrocyte proliferation, resulting in severe or even lethal human skeletal dysplasias, such as achondroplasia and thanatophoric dysplasia [3, 4]. Interestingly, the excessive FGFR3 activation in skeletal dysplasia targets several pathways known to be dysregulated in chondrosarcoma, such as chondrocyte growth factors IHH and parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP), the component of extracellular matrix collagen type 2, and cell cycle regulators CDK4 and CDK6 [1, 4, 5]. Altogether, the abovementioned evidence suggests that the therapeutic effect of FGFR3 activation in chondrosarcoma is worth evaluation. To determine whether the chondrosarcoma growth may be attenuated by FGFR3, we first need to establish if the chondrosarcoma cells retain their responsiveness to the FGFR3 activation. Although early studies demonstrate that FGFR3 activation causes potent growth-arrest in cultivated chondrosarcoma cells [6], in vivo evidence is necessary to confirm these data. Crossing of animals carrying mildly activating FGFR3 mutation, such as G380R which is typical for achondroplasia, with established transgenic mice models to chondrosarcoma should confirm the inhibitory effect of FGFR3 activation on chondrosarcoma growth in vivo. Subsequently, a feasible mode of FGFR3 activation in the chondrosarcoma lesions needs to be found. This should not pose a significant problem, since growth plate FGFR3 may be activated via administration of FGF ligand, FGF2, as shown in both limb explant cultures as well as transgenic mice engineered to overexpress FGF2 [4, 7]. In addition, the in vivo FGF2 administration appears to be safe, according to studies evaluating FGF2 effect on periodontal regeneration [8].\n",

To determine whether the chondrosarcoma growth may be attenuated by FGFR3, we first need to establish if the chondrosarcoma cells retain their responsiveness to the FGFR3 activation. Although early studies demonstrate that FGFR3 activation causes potent growth-arrest in cultivated chondrosarcoma cells [6], in vivo evidence is necessary to confirm these data. Crossing of animals carrying mildly activating FGFR3 mutation, such as G380R which is typical for achondroplasia, with established transgenic mice models to chondrosarcoma should confirm the inhibitory effect of FGFR3 activation on chondrosarcoma growth in vivo. Subsequently, a feasible mode of FGFR3 activation in the chondrosarcoma lesions needs to be found. This should not pose a significant problem, since growth plate FGFR3 may be activated via administration of FGF ligand, FGF2, as shown in both limb explant cultures as well as transgenic mice engineered to overexpress FGF2 [4, 7]. In addition, the in vivo FGF2 administration appears to be safe, according to studies evaluating FGF2 effect on periodontal regeneration [8].\n",

      "Full Abstract: Introduction. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is one of the major oncogenes in a variety of human cancers including breast cancer (BC). While EGFR overexpression and/or amplification has been shown to occur frequently in human breast cancer, EGFR-activating mutations are suggested to be rare if not absent. Thus, the aim of our study was to examine the presence of somatic EGFR gene mutations in a group of norwegian patients diagnosed with early breast cancer. Patients. We investigated tumor biopsies obtained from 132 patients with early breast cancer treated at the Akershus University Hospital (University of Oslo) in 2007/2008. The majority of patients (n = 82) belonged to the luminal- A/B subtypes of BC. In addition, 33 patients were classified as HER-2 positive patients (IHC 3+ or amplification verified by FISH) and 17 as triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Methods. Briefly, DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue using QIAsymphony DSP DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc.). The extraction of DNA was performed by fully automated purification using the QIAsymphony SP/AS system. EGFR-mutations were detected using a Therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR kit according to the manufacturers protocol. We tested for point mutations in exon 18 (G719A/C/S), in-frame deletions in exon 19 (E746-A750), in-frame insertions as well as point mutations in exon 20 (S768I, T790M) and a point mutation in exon 21 (L858R). Results. In the present study we detected three individuals with an EGFR-T790M mutation. Two of the patients were diagnosed with TNBC, while the disease of the third patient was classified as a luminal-A type breast cancer. Interestingly, the T790M-mutation was present in the biopsies obtained during surgery before adjuvant therapy was initiated. No anti-cancer therapy has been given prior to surgery. According to our best knowledge, the T790M-TKI-resistance-mutation has not been detected in early breast cancer previously. This finding contrasts the observations made in lung cancer patients where the T790M mutation in general is a classical second mutation causing drug resistance during ongoing TKI-therapy. No other EGFR-mutations were detected in our patients. Conclusion: To our best knowledge we provide first evidence for the presence of the EGFR-T790M-mutation in human early breast cancer.

      "Full Abstract: Adult granulosa cell tumors (aGCT) represent 2-5% of all ovarian cancers. Most patients present with stage 1 disease and have a good prognosis, however up to 30% of aGCTs will recur (median=7 years), and 50% of these patients die of aGCT. These women require prolonged surveillance for serum tumor markers. In recent years, the detection of somatic mutations in free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma has been investigated as a non-invasive method to diagnose and monitor different cancers. The analysis of plasma DNA, which is a mixture of ctDNA and normal DNA, can be extended to aGCT patients that are at risk to recur, which would involve testing for the presence of the FOXL2 402C->G mutation. This mutation is known to be present in 95% of aGCTs; FOXL2 mutation testing is currently being used to aid in tumor differential diagnosis. FOXL2 mutations in free ctDNA can be detected in the plasma of aGCT patients and may aid in diagnosis and monitoring of patients. Plasma samples (1-2mL) were extracted for ctDNA using the Qiagen circulating nucleic acid kit. The ctDNA was preamplified for 10 cycles using the C134W FOXL2 Taqman primer/probe, ABI genotyping mix, followed by a 1:5 dilution. Preamplified ctDNA products were subjected to droplet formation and counted on the Raindance Raindrop digital PCR instruments to detect wild type or mutant alleles. All analysis was performed using the Raindrop Analyst V2 software. Of two aGCT cases tested, both showed detectable plasma ctDNA FOXL2 mutations using Raindance Raindrop digital PCR. For case 1, plasma from two subsequent time points were tested. The FOXL2 mutation was not detected in the first time point, 12 years from diagnosis, at which time the patient had relapsed disease and underwent chemotherapy. Surgery for extensive tumor burden was performed at the second time point, 6 months later, and a 16% allelic frequency of the FOXL2 mutation was detected in the plasma DNA. For case 2, two plasma samples were tested, the first from the primary surgery, the second at relapse two years later. The FOXL2 ctDNA mutation was present at 6% in the recurrent plasma sample, but not at primary diagnosis. The recurrence was originally diagnosed as a high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, however the tumor was FOXL2 mutation positive and later re-diagnosed as a relapsed aGCT. The analysis of two cases of aGCT plasma suggests that the pathognomonic aGCT associated FOXL2 mutation is present in recurrent disease. We also show that the presence of a ctDNA FOXL2 mutation confirms the differential diagnosis of recurrent disease. This is the first proof of principle that plasma DNA may be a non-invasive method to detect recurrent aGCT. Plasma samples from a large prospective cohort with primary or recurrent aGCT will be analyzed to test the sensitive of FOXL2 ctDNA to predict tumor burden. These studies will be imperative to determine the utilization of the plasma FOXL2 ctDNA mutation in routine diagnosis. Citation Format: Melissa K.

      "Full Abstract: Analysis of circulating cell-free DNA in blood is considered as a liquid biopsy, which enables non-invasive and repetitive investigation of the tumor DNA. The potential clinical usefulness of circulating DNA is frequently examined in lung cancer. Thus, our aim was assessment if chemotherapy influences the circulating DNA concentration.Fifty-seven lung cancer patients in advanced stages of the disease were examined. Quantification of circulating DNA was determined by TERT amplification.Distant metastases and chemotherapy were significantly connected with circulating DNA level. Patients treated with conventional chemotherapy had statistically lower circulating DNA levels when compared to patients not treated with chemotherapy. Histological types of tumor and smoking status were not associated with circulating DNA concentration. In this study, we have also genotyped the EGFR mutations in exon 19 of circulating DNA using the TaqMan PCR assays. One patient carried a deletion (2235-49del in EGFR), which has been confirmed by sequencing.Circulating DNA is easy to obtain, convenient biological material, although quantitative analysis cannot be used as diagnostic tool, but it can be applied to determination of EGFR mutations, basis of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors application.\n",

The activity of nivolumab in subgroups of patients with tumors which have wild-typeBRAFkinase vs patients with tumors having mutantBRAFhas not systematically been explored in a large dataset. Objective To evaluate the efficacy and safety of nivolumab in patients with wild-typeBRAFand mutantBRAFmetastatic melanoma. Design, Setting, and Participants This was a retrospective analysis of data pooled from 4 clinical trials of nivolumab in 440 adult patients with unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma, who had been tested forBRAFmutational status while participating in one of the studies. Intervention The investigational drug, nivolumab, was administered intravenously to study participants over a 60-minute period, at doses of 0.1, 0.3, 1.0, 3.0, or 10.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression, discontinuation owing to adverse events, withdrawal, or end of study. Most patients (83%) received nivolumab at a dosage of 3 mg/kg. Main Outcome and Measure Best overall response by modified World Health Organization or Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors criteria and safety profile. Results Of a total of 440 patients from 4 nivolumab clinical trials included in the analysis, 334 wereBRAFwild-type and 106 were positive forBRAFV600 mutation. With the exception of priorBRAFinhibitor therapy, the demographics were well balanced between the 2 cohorts. In patients evaluable for response, the objective response rates were 34.6% (95% CI, 28.3-41.3) for the 217 patients with wild-typeBRAFstatus and 29.7% (95% CI, 19.7-41.5) for the 74 with mutantBRAFstatus. The objective response rates did not seem to be affected by priorBRAFinhibitor therapy, prior ipilimumab therapy, or PD-L1 status of the tumor. The median duration of objective response was 14.8 months (95% CI, 11.1-24.0 months) for wild-typeBRAFand 11.2 months (95% CI, 7.3-22.9 months) for mutantBRAF. Median time to objective response was 2.2 months in both patient groups. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events of any grade was 68.3% in the wild-typeBRAFgroup and 58.5% in the mutantBRAFgroup, with grade 3 or 4 adverse events in 11.7% and 2.8% of patients, respectively. Treatment-related AEs of any grade that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either group were fatigue, pruritus, rash, and diarrhea. Conclusions and Relevance The results of this retrospective analysis suggest that nivolumab has similar efficacy and safety outcomes in patients with wild-type or mutantBRAF, regardless of priorBRAFinhibitor or ipilimumab treatment.\n",

      "Full Abstract: HER2 amplification and activating mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the p110 subunit of PI3K, often co-occur in breast cancer. We generated a transgenic mouse model of HER2-overexpressing (HER2+), PIK3CAH1047R-mutant breast cancer. In these mice, PIK3CAH1047R accelerates HER2-mediated mammary epithelial transformation and metastatic progression, confers stem cell-like properties to HER2-overexpressing cancers and generates resistance to the combination of trastuzumab and pertuzumab (Hanker et al. PNAS 2013). HER2+/PIK3CA tumor growth was inhibited by treatment with the HER2 antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab in combination with the pan-PI3K inhibitor BKM120 (TPB). We sought to discover mechanisms of acquired resistance to the triple therapy by long-term treatment of established HER2+/PIK3CA tumors. We used tumor transplants derived from two HER2+/PIK3CA transgenic mice, #564 and #635. Tumor transplants from model 564 were initially growth inhibited by TPB, but did not regress. A subset of 564 transplants (3/11) resumed growth in the presence of continuous TPB therapy. All transplants (n=9) from model 635 regressed to a volume of 5 months) in the presence of the three drugs. Similar to the TPB-resistant tumors, P-S6 was no longer inhibited following TPB treatment in the resistant cell lines. Treatment with the TORC1/2 inhibitor MLN0128 abolished levels of P-S6 in HER2+/PIK3CAH1047R tumors. Combined treatment with MLN0128 and TPB inhibited growth of the drug-resistant tumors. Interestingly, Both TPB-resistant HER2+/PIK3CAH1047R tumor lines displayed resistance to the antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1) in vitro and in vivo, despite maintenance of HER2 overexpression. In addition, HCC1954 cells selected for resistance to TPB in culture were 66-fold less sensitive to T-DM1 than parental cells, despite maintaining equal levels of HER2 by western blot. These data suggest that multiple mechanisms may contribute to resistance to dual HER2 and PI3K blockade, including re-activation of mTOR signaling. We speculate that a similar heterogeneity of resistance mechanisms may occur in HER2+/PIK3CA-mutant metastases in patients.

      "Full Abstract: Melanoma is the most lethal skin cancer and approximately 50% of the cases harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, with the mutation V600E representing 80-90% of all BRAF mutations in this indication. BRAF inhibitors as Vemurafenib and Dabrafenib have shown improved overall and progression free survival; however, the long term efficacy of these compounds is limited by the emergence of resistance. Several mechanisms of resistance to BRAF inhibitors have been already described, such as BRAF overexpression, increased ERBB3 signaling, expression of BRAF alternative isoforms, secondary mutations in BRAF or MEK1 and recently BRAF amplifications, among others. A fundamental aspect on devising optimal therapeutic regimes that overcome resistance is to develop preclinical models that resemble the genetic makeup of clinical patients who become resistance during the course of treatment to BRAF inhibitors. To this end, melanoma primary tumor xenografts (PTX) harboring BRAF V600E mutations were subject to treatment with BRAF inhibitors and response data was collected for a maximum of 180 days. Vehicle and treated samples were then sequenced using a targeted next generation sequencing approach in order to characterize their mutational landscape. Raw sequencing data was aligned to the human genome and potential mouse contamination was filter out before downstream analysis. Comparing SNV and copy number calls between treated and control samples revealed that focal amplifications of BRAF and de-novo mutations in the MEK1 gene were frequent genetic aberrations found in the PTX models that developed resistance. In summary, our results indicate that the genetic mechanisms of resistance observed in primary tumor xenograft models closely resemble what is observed in the clinical setting, making these models a valuable research tool for designing optimal therapeutic strategies.

      "Full Abstract: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematopoietic malignancy characterized by the clonal expansion and accumulation of immature blasts in the bone marrow. Several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including internal tandem duplication mutations of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD) or mutations of the Proto-oncogene c-Kit (c-Kit N822K or D816V), are involved in the pathogenesis of AML. Another major point of resistance of leukemic cells to chemotherapy is their inability to activate cell death pathways, because of overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-2.). In this study we worked on the antileukemic activity of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-DG), a glycolysis and N-linked-glycosylation inhibitor, which have been described in different cancer models to sensitize to chemotherapy. First we evaluated the effects of 2-DG on cell proliferation and apoptosis. We showed that 2-DG inhibited more strongly cell proliferation of MV4-11, MOLM-14, Kasumi-1 and TF1 c-Kit D816V cell lines than U-937. In accordance with this result, 2-DG induced apoptosis in all AML cell lines previously cited excluding U-937. We also used the murine model BaF/3 stably transfected with FLT3-ITD, c-Kit D816V or BCR-ABL, and showed that cells transformed with a membrane tyrosine kinase were more sensitize to 2-DG than cell expressing the cytoplasmic oncogene BCR-ABL. Moreover, 2-DG induced apoptosis in primary FLT3-ITD AML samples (n=9) or c-Kit D816V mutated samples (n=5). At molecular level, 2-DG inhibited N-linked-glycosylation of FLT3-ITD and c-Kit mutants both in cell lines and primary AML samples, leading to a decrease of cell surface expression of these RTKs. We also showed that 2-DG overcomes the resistance to AC-220 in a MOLM-14 ITD/TKD model, by triggering the deglycosylation of the receptor. Furthermore, 2-DG exposure decreased ERK and STAT3/5 signaling but, surprisingly, not the AKT pathway in FLT3-ITD or c-Kit mutated models. Cell exposure to 2-DG and D-mannose, which restores N-linked-glycosylation but not glycolysis, demonstrated that 2-DG induced apoptosis and inhibition of RTKs cell surface expression are independent of the effects of 2-DG on glycolysis. In another part, we have demonstrated that 2-DG was able to decrease protein expression of the anti apoptotic protein mcl-1 in sensitive and resistant cells as well as in primary patient samples. These results correlated with the fact that in some cells, like lymphoma cells, mcl-1 synthesis is glycolysis-dependent. We took advantage of this decrease to associate the 2-DG with cytotoxic agents ABT-737 or cytarabine (Ara-C) and showed that these combinations (Ara-C+2-DG or ABT-737+2-DG) were synergistic. Our study shows that dual targeting of glycolysis and N-linked-glycosylation is an attractive therapeutic strategy in acute myeloid leukemia. Note: This abstract was not presented at the meeting.

      "Full Abstract: In lung adenocarcinomas, targeted therapy with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) erlotinib and gefitinib is associated with longer progression free survival (PFS). However, despite the initial success, all patients progress with a median PFS of 12 to 16 months. Acquired resistance is driven by the occurrence of a secondary EGFR mutation (T790M) in about 50% of the cases and by c-Met amplification in 5 to 10 % of the cases. We report the activity of a new reversible and ATP-competitive c-Met inhibitor, EMD1214063, in the setting of primary lung adenocarcinomas harboring EGFR activating mutations and in two models of acquired resistance. EMD1214063 showed to be specifically active in c-Met amplified and c-Met dependent cells in a large panel of genotypically characterized lung cancer cell lines. In the context of acquired resistance, we studied the effect of EMD1214063 alone and in combination of afatinib, an irreversible EGFR TKI, in PC9 cells (EGFR Exon19del), H1975 cells (EGFR L858R and T790M), HCC827 (EGFR Exon19del, not c-Met amplified) and in HCC827GR cells (EGFR Exon19del and c-Met amplified). Treatment of HCC827GR cells with EMD1214063 resulted in substantial growth inhibition and induced apoptosis. The in vitro results showed a significant synergistic effect of the combination of EMD121039 and afatinib in the induction of growth inhibition in the context of c-Met amplification and EGFR T790M mutation. Combination treatment robustly suppressed expression of downstream pErk and pAkt, showing efficient suppression of PI3K and MAPK signaling. To determine whether the antitumor activity of the combination observed in vitro might also be apparent in vivo, we injected these cells in nude mice to elicit the formation of solid tumors. Mice were treated with EMD121043 (25mg/kg), afatinib (10mg/kg) or the combination of both. In H1975 xenografts only the combination therapy could significantly reduce tumor growth, thus confirming the results obtained in vitro. In the c-Met amplified setting, we treated mice harboring HCC827, HCC827GR and mixed xenografts. HCC827-driven tumors strongly responded to both afatinib monotherapy and to the combination, leading to complete remission within 40 days of therapy. HCC827/HCC827GR mixed xenografts containing 0.1%, 1% and 10% of HCC827GR cells partially responded to afatinib monotherapy; however, growth was completely abolished by combination therapy. Treatment with EMD1214063 led to significant growth reduction in mice harboring HCC827GR tumors. In this model, only the combination therapy led to massive tumor shrinkage. Assessment of cell proliferation in vivo by [18F]FLT-PET showed a decline in FLT-uptake of 40% in both the combination therapy and the EMD1214063 monotherapy. In conclusion, the combination of EMD1214063 and afatinib promote tumor regression in erlotinib acquired resistant lung cancers driven by EGFR L858R/T790M or EGFR Exon19 del/c-Met amplification.

In the context of acquired resistance, we studied the effect of EMD1214063 alone and in combination of afatinib, an irreversible EGFR TKI, in PC9 cells (EGFR Exon19del), H1975 cells (EGFR L858R and T790M), HCC827 (EGFR Exon19del, not c-Met amplified) and in HCC827GR cells (EGFR Exon19del and c-Met amplified). Treatment of HCC827GR cells with EMD1214063 resulted in substantial growth inhibition and induced apoptosis. The in vitro results showed a significant synergistic effect of the combination of EMD121039 and afatinib in the induction of growth inhibition in the context of c-Met amplification and EGFR T790M mutation. Combination treatment robustly suppressed expression of downstream pErk and pAkt, showing efficient suppression of PI3K and MAPK signaling. To determine whether the antitumor activity of the combination observed in vitro might also be apparent in vivo, we injected these cells in nude mice to elicit the formation of solid tumors. Mice were treated with EMD121043 (25mg/kg), afatinib (10mg/kg) or the combination of both. In H1975 xenografts only the combination therapy could significantly reduce tumor growth, thus confirming the results obtained in vitro. In the c-Met amplified setting, we treated mice harboring HCC827, HCC827GR and mixed xenografts. HCC827-driven tumors strongly responded to both afatinib monotherapy and to the combination, leading to complete remission within 40 days of therapy. HCC827/HCC827GR mixed xenografts containing 0.1%, 1% and 10% of HCC827GR cells partially responded to afatinib monotherapy; however, growth was completely abolished by combination therapy. Treatment with EMD1214063 led to significant growth reduction in mice harboring HCC827GR tumors. In this model, only the combination therapy led to massive tumor shrinkage. Assessment of cell proliferation in vivo by [18F]FLT-PET showed a decline in FLT-uptake of 40% in both the combination therapy and the EMD1214063 monotherapy. In conclusion, the combination of EMD1214063 and afatinib promote tumor regression in erlotinib acquired resistant lung cancers driven by EGFR L858R/T790M or EGFR Exon19 del/c-Met amplification.

      "Full Abstract: The tyrosine kinase receptor HER2 (ErbB2/neu) is predominantly localized to the basolateral membrane of the epithelium and has been implicated in mammary tumorigenesis as well as in resistance to chemotherapy and radiation. Here we demonstrate that HER2 interacts with discs large 1 (DLG1) that is one of PDZ domain proteins expressed at the basolateral membrane of human breast epithelial cells and plays an important role in the establishment and maintenance of epithelial polarity in Drosophila. However, either loss of the last 6 C-terminal amino acids (HER2- ) or a valine-to-alanine C-terminal substitution (HER2-V1255A) in HER2, abrogates the interaction with DLG1. In contrast, either PDZ domain 1 or 3 within Dlg1 is required for interaction with HER2. Moreover, HER2- - or HER2-V1255A-expressing MCF10A human breast epithelial cells show the reduction of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (EMT) proteins including vimentin and Snail. In addition, HER2-wt cells promotes EMT as shown by down-regulation of E-cadherin and upregulation of vimentin and Snail. Taken together, these results indicate that C-terminal PDZ binding domain in HER2 modulates biological functions of HER2. These results reveal new insight into the structure and function of HER2, which may guide the design and development of new anti-cancer targets to treat HER2-positive breast cancer.

      "Full Abstract: Neuroblastoma (NBL) is the third most common malignancy in children and accounts for more than 15% of cancer-related deaths in children in the US. Approximately 50% of patients present with advanced-stage and/or high risk disease. Despite significant intensification of conventional chemotherapy regimens, the long-term survival rates for these children remain less than 40%. A somewhat improved outcome has been obtained with multimodality therapeutic approaches including chemotherapy, surgery, autologous bone marrow transplantation, radiation therapy and use of biological agents. However, long-term survival rates for children with high-risk disease remain poor and survivors experience significant immediate and late toxicities which further limits conventional chemotherapy dose intensification. Novel biological therapies are therefore much needed. Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC), also known as osteonectin or BM-40, belongs to the matricellular family of secreted proteins, which also includes thrombospondin 1 and 2, osteopontin, and tenascins C and X. The biological functions of SPARC are known to be variable in human cancers. In neuroblastoma however, SPARC expression has been found to be associated with impaired tumor growth and angiogenesis. Our previous studies showed that overexpression of SPARC induced autophagy-mediated apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. In the present study we have attempted to decipher the mechanisms of this apoptotic induction. We used two neuroblastoma cell lines SK-N-BE2 (p53mt) and NB1691 (p53wt) and transfected them with plasmid overexpressing Myc-DDK-tagged SPARC with and without ionizing radiation. We observed that overexpression of SPARC accompanied with ionizing radiation (5Gy) suppressed HSP27 in NB1691 (5-fold) and SK-N-BE(2) (2-fold) cells. Further we also observed that expression of p21(CIP1/WAF1) was increased in SPARC overexpressed radiated (5Gy) cells; 4-fold in NB1691 cells and 0.5-fold SK-N-BE(2) cells. Levels of cyclin B were also found to be increased in both SK-N-BE2 (3-fold) and NB1691 (5-fold) after exposure to radiation. However SPARC overexpression in radiated cells caused a decrease in levels of Cyclin B in NB1691 (-3 fold) and SK-N-BE(2) (-2 fold) cells. Cell cycle analysis revealed that radiation induced G2-phase arrest in both NB1691 and SK-N-BE(2) cells. This G2 phase arrest was followed by decreased mitochondrial membrane potential () in SPARC overexpressed cells when compared to controls. We further observed that suppression of native SPARC by siRNA in both SK-N-BE2 and NB1691 cells altered their sensitivity to radiation as determined by MTT assay. Our results demonstrate that SPARC expression regulates radiation sensitivity in NB1691 (p53wt) and to a lesser extent in SK-N-BE2 (p53mt) cells via modulation of the heat shock protein HSP27 and the DNA damage response molecule p21(CIP1/WAF1).

      "Full Abstract: of a dissertation at the University of Miami. Dissertation supervised by Professor Joyce M. Slingerland. No. of pages in text. (116) Many transcription factors undergo transcription-coupled proteolysis. While ligand binding activates ubiquitin-proteolysis of estrogen receptor (ER), mechanisms governing this and its relationship to transcriptional activation were unclear. In this thesis, I present the evidence indicating that different ubiquitin ligases, including E6-AP and SCF regulate ER protein stability and transcriptional activity. Data from E6-AP project presented link crosstalk between the Src kinase and liganded ER with ER activation and its ubiquitylation. Liganded ER rapidly activates and recruits Src which phosphorylates ER at tyrosine 537 (Y537). This enhances ER binding to the ubiquitin ligase/ER coactivator, E6-AP, stimulating ER ubiquitylation, target gene activation and ultimately ER loss. ER phosphorylation by Src promotes ER ubiquitylation by E6-AP and proteasomal degradation in vitro. Src inhibition impairs estrogen-activated ER:E6-AP binding, reducing ER degradation. ER-Y537F shows little estrogen stimulated degradation and activates native ER target genes poorly. Src activation enhances ER and E6-AP binding and their occupancy at ER target gene promoters to enhance transcription. Thus, ERY537 phosphorylation drives ER:E6-AP binding to at least a subset of target promoters, linking transcriptional activation to ER degradation and providing a novel mechanism to fine tune ER action. Data from SKP2 project support a model in which estrogen-activated CyclinE-CDK2 binds and phosphorylates ERS341, to prime ER-SCF binding via SKP2L248QTLL252 in late G1. SKP2 activates ER ubiquitylation and proteolysis. Putative late ER targets were identified by expression profiling, SKP2 knockdown attenuated E2F-1 and BLM induction. SKP2 overexpression, but not coactivator motif mutant SKP2L248QTAA252, enhanced estrogen-induced E2F-1 and BLM expression. SKP2 knockdown impaired estrogen-stimulated ER, SKP2, SRC3 and PolII recruitment to E2F-1 and BLM promoters. This work not only identifies these late-activated genes as bone fide ER targets but describes a novel mechanism for their periodic activation. SKP2 serves as dual ER E3 ligase/coactivator for late-activated target genes, revealing a novel mechanism whereby ER/ SCF transactivation of E2F-1 feeds forward to drive G1to-S. Preliminary data from FBXL6 project suggested another F-box protein, FBXL6, as a putative ER coactivator. FBXL6 protein and mRNA levels are cell cycle regulated, rising in early G1 to peak in late G1 and S phases. FBXL6 co-precipitates with SCF ubiquitin ligase components: cellular SKP1, RBX1, CUL1 and ER. Estrogen stimulates FBXL6-ER binding and this is inhibited by tamoxifen treatment Effects of FBXL6 overexpression and knockdown on estrogen stimulated ER proteolysis are being evaluated. Ectopic FBXL6 expression increases ER transcriptional activity in reporter assay, supporting a role for FBXL6 as an ER coactivator. Since FBXL6 levels and its binding to ER increase in late G1, we postulate that estrogen stimulated ER targets, coregulated by FBXL6 also rise late, 9-12 hours after estrogen stimulation. Our gene expression array analysis revealed a subset of putative late ER target genes including CENPQ, CHAF1B, CDC6, and RAD54B, whose expression increases by over two fold between 6 and 12 hours after estrogen stimulation. Estrogen stimulates ER and FBXL6 binding to the CDC6 promoter in ChIP assays and FBXL6 knockdown diminishes estrogen-stimulated CDC6 expression. Cdc6 plays a key role to initiate DNA replication and its induction by ER-FBXL6 may represent a critical gatekeeping role for ER on DNA replication. The influence of FBXL6 on late ER target gene selection and biological consequence of the target selection are under investigation. Completion of these studies will provide novel mechanistic insights into FBXL6-ER-mediated transcriptional regulation, which may critically regulate DNA replication and repair to affect genome plasticity. Experimental work of this thesis has elucidated novel molecular mechanisms whereby E3 ubiquitin ligases play dual roles as ER coactivators. These studies link ER proteolysis and activation of ER target genes and may not only prove to be relevant to hormone regulation of breast cancer but also reveal mechanisms whereby low level receptor expression governs gene action in several normal target tissues.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Background: Although BRAF V600-mutated (BRAFm) colorectal carcinoma (CRC) does not generally respond to BRAF inhibitors, results of preclinical studies suggest strong synergistic activity between a BRAF inhibitor and an EGFR inhibitor or a PI3K inhibitor. The aims of this study were to establish safety and preliminary activity of combination therapy with encorafenib (ENC), a highly selective BRAF V600 inhibitor, the EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab (CTX), the -specific PI3K inhibitor alpelisib (ALP) in patients (pts) with BRAFm CRC; and assess the potential clinical significance of biomarkers and microsatellite instability (MSI) status by genomic analysis of tumor samples. Methods: In this phase I study, the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase II dose (RP2D) was determined and safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity of ENC + CTX ALP were evaluated, in pts with advanced BRAFm/KRAS wild-type CRC. Archival or fresh screening tumor samples were analyzed for somatic mutations and copy number aberrations to evaluate potential correlation with response. Results: Fifty-four pts were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase; 26 in the dual arm (ENC + CTX) and 28 in the triple arm (ENC + ALP + CTX). RP2D for each treatment arm was established as 200 mg ENC QD + CTX weekly (dual arm) + 300 mg ALP once daily (triple arm). The most common grade 3/4 treatment-related adverse events were fatigue and hypophosphatemia in the dual arm (8% each), and nausea and hypophosphatemia in the triple arm (4% each). Hyperglycemia was observed in one patient (3.8%) in the dual arm and 8 patients (29%) in the triple arm. Overall response rates ( partial response [PR]) for the dual and triple arms were 23% (1 CR, 4 PR, and 1 unconfirmed (u) PR) and 32% (4 PR and 5 uPR), respectively. Median progression-free survival was 3.7 and 4.3 months, respectively. Biomarker analysis was performed on 21 tumor samples. Several genetic alterations occurred with similar frequency between patient samples and the FoundationOne database (PIK3CA, TP53, APC). Specifically, the PIK3CA mutation and PTEN alterations were found in 24% and 38% of patient samples, respectively; however, these alterations did not appear to be correlated with response. Non-MSI-high status was associated with a lower PFS for the dual arm (2.8 vs 3.7 months), but not the triple arm (4.4 vs 4.3 months). Updated biomarker analyses, including MSI status, will be presented. Conclusions: These results indicate that both ENC + CTX and ENC + CTX + ALP are well tolerated with promising antitumor activity in pts with advanced BRAFm CRC who failed at least one prior therapy. Additional biomarker analyses will help to clarify the clinical significance of genetic alterations, particularly with MSI status and the PI3K pathway.

      "Full Abstract: Purpose In complement to anti-EGFR therapy, the targeting of PI3KCA/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway is of particular interest in the management of HNSCC. Its activation is recognized as an important mechanism in tumor progression and resistance to EGFR inhibitors. Of importance, PI3KCA inhibitors have shown their ability to selectively inhibit the PI3KCA/AKT signalling and to enhance the effects of conventional cytotoxic agents. Therefore, it would be particularly interesting to assess the effects of PI3KCA inhibition combined with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (cetuximab) and/or irradiation (RT). Experimental procedures We identified two HNSCC cell lines (Cal 33, PIK3CA H1047R mutated and Cal 27, wild type) and examined the effects of the combination of BKM120 (specific inhibitor of PI3KCA), cetuximab and RT. Experimental conditions were: BKM120, cetuximab, RT alone; sequence 1 (BKM120 followed by cetuximab), sequence 2 (cetuximab followed by BKM120) and combination (BKM120 + cetuximab together) with/without RT given ahead of all treatments. Drugs were administered at their IC50. Cell survival was assessed by MTT test. Combination effects were analyzed by the Combination Index (CI) and Compusyn software. Biochemical factors were examined for the impact on proliferation, apoptosis (caspases), DNA repair (ERCC1, XRCC1, DNA-PK, ATM) and PI3KCA/AKT/mTOR pathway p-P70/S6k, p-Akt/Akt, PTEN). Gene expression was determined by real time-PCR and protein expression by western blot. Results We evidenced sequence 2 as the best combined treatment in inhibiting cell proliferation in both cell lines (IC50 = - 7.91*10-6 M in Cal 7 and IC50 = - 5.7*10-6 M in Cal 33; being IC50 the difference of IC50 between sequence 2 and BKM120 alone). CI values confirmed a synergistic interaction between the two drugs given sequentially cetuximab + BKM120 in both cell lines. Addition of RT ahead of all treatments did not add any anti-proliferative effect to the treatments on Cal 33. Of note, on Cal 27 the addition of RT to BKM120 increased the antiproliferative effect of this drug (p .AM2014-1876\n",

      "Full Abstract: Background: Non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) constitute the majority of lung cancer cases, whose risk is associated with environmental factors, such as air pollution, and smoking habits. KRAS mutations are present in about 20% of NSCLC patients, mostly at codon 12 and have been associated to tumor progression and resistance to chemotherapy in many types of cancer. Increasingly evidences seem to highlight that the definition of KRAS status is not sufficient to determine its predictive and/or prognostic role in NSCLC, and indicate that different KRAS mutations could differently impact on crucial cellular processes. An issue still to be addressed is whether different KRAS mutations may modulate cellular metabolism with possible implications on different response to anticancer treatments which specifically inhibit metabolism modulating pathways, such as the PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis. Methods: We generated from the human NSCLC cell line NCI-H1299 clones overexpressing WT KRAS, and the three most common NSCLC KRAS mutations (G12C, G12V and G12D). The clones were used to determine in vitro response to PI3K, mTOR and AMPK interfering agents. We applied an explorative mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics strategy to characterize the largest possible number of metabolites that might distinguish the different KRAS mutated clones. Results: KRAS overexpressing clones resulted sensitive to the PI3K inhibitors BKM-120 and PIK-75 and to the PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor BEZ-235. Metformin (acting on AMPK) did not display a cytotoxic activity on the clones at concentrations below or equal to 1mM. Metabolomics analyses revealed that clones harboring different KRAS mutations at codon 12 had different metabolic remodellings such as different redox buffering system and different glutamine-dependency. Conclusion: The preliminary findings reported herein indicate that specific KRAS mutations at codon 12 are associated to different metabolomics profiles that might have an impact to the response to anticancer treatments. Combination studies including metformin and PI3K/mTOR interfering agents and more detailed metabolomics analyses are ongoing in order to clarify whether metabolic adaptations dependent on KRAS mutants might account for the behaviour of KRAS overexpressing clones treated with different drugs.

      "Full Abstract: The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in the genesis of several human cancers, is a promising therapeutic target in Neuroblastoma (NB). Many studies on sporadic cases with advanced NB have shown ALK mutated or highly expressed independently of its genetic status (mutated, amplified, wild-type) and its pivotal role in NB growth and survival. As ALK is currently considered a master driver of NB oncogenesis, the use of therapies inhibiting ALK represents a suitable treatment option. The ALK inhibitor Crizotinib was recently approved for the treatment of advanced NSCLC patient. However, as often observed with kinase inhibitors, some patients develop acquired resistance in part due to genetic ALK mutations. To overcome this limitation a selective and more potent ALK inhibitor, X-396, was developed that is currently in phase I clinical trial in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, but it has not been tested in preclinical animal models of NB. We have successfully employed a RNAi-mediated therapeutic approach to selectively knockdown ALK expression by using nanoliposomes entrapping siRNA and coupled with anti-GD2 antibodies to target NB cells. Our data demonstrate for the first time a role of ALK in NB-induced angiogenesis and in tumor invasion. Here, we aimed to test whether the combination of the novel ALK kinase inhibitor X-396 with the liposome-based silencing of ALK could represent a powerful synergistic and or additive effect in NB xenografts to promote long-term survival. In vitro, X-396 showed to be more effective than Crizotinib in inhibiting cell proliferation and in inducing cell death in both LAN-5 (R1275Q ALK mut, Crizotinib-sensitive) and SH-SY5Y (F1174L ALK mut, Crizotinib-resistant) cells. Pharmacokinetic profiles of X-396 after multiple PO administration in NB-xenografts revealed a good bioavailability and a moderate half-life. Biodistribution study clearly indicated that the concentration of X-396 8h post-administration was 35 fold higher in the tumor site than in plasma. X-396 reduced the tumor volume in subcutaneous SH-SY5Y NB-model in a dose-dependent manner and it was more effective than Crizotinib when administered at the same concentration. In orthotopic xenografts of SH-SY5Y and LAN-5 cells, X-396 significantly increased life span. In combination studies, all effects were significantly improved in the mice treated with targeted liposomal formulation of ALK-siRNA and X-396 compared to untreated control mice or mice receiving the single agent treatments. In the latter studies, further enhancement of life span was obtained by increasing the X-396 dose. Moreover, the combined treatment was also proven to be effective in the SH-SY5Y-pseudometastatic model in determining long-term survivors. Our findings provide a rational basis to design innovative molecular-based combination of treatments for clinical application in NB.

      "Full Abstract: Germline and somatic point mutations of RET receptor tyrosine kinase cause multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Moreover, RET gene rearrangements are associated to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Recently Vandetanib (ZD6474), a multiple kinase inhibitor (KI) targeting RET, has been approved for MTC treatment. We tested 22 novel KIs with different structure and specificity for their ability to inhibit RET activity in NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing MTC-associated RET C634R and M918T oncogenic mutants. Among them, we selected three structurally similar type II tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ALW-II-41-27, HG-6-63-01 and XMD15-44, that were able to significantly reduce RET phosphorylation at 10 nM dose. ALW-II-41-27, HG-6-63-01 and XMD15-44 blocked RET-mediated signaling and proliferation with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than 50 nM in rat fibroblasts transformed by RET/C634R and RET/M918T, while they were poorly effective on parental RAT1 cells (IC50 >200nM). Although with different efficacy, the three compounds inhibited various MTC-associated RET intracellular mutants (RET E768D, L790F, Y791F, S891A, V804L/M and A883F) and RET chimeric oncogenes (RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3, KIF5B-RET and FGFR1OP-RET). In addition, ALW-II-41-27, HG-6-63-01 and XMD15-44 inhibited RET activity and signaling in human cell lines (TT, MZCRC1 and TPC1) carrying oncogenic RET alleles (C634W, M918T and RET/PTC1, respectively) and blocked the growth of TT and MZCRC1 cells with an IC50 of 1-5 nM and of TPC1 cells with an IC50 of 10-50 nM. Proliferation of non-tumoral human thyroid follicular cells (Nthy-ori 3-1) growth was virtually unaffected (IC50 nM). Finally, in nude mice, ALW-II-41-27 (40 mg/kg i.p once per day) reduced growth of RET/C634Y-fibroblast xenografts by more than 50% (1,280 mm3 drug-treated vs 2,810 mm3 vehicle-treated). In conclusion, we have identified a pharmacophore (3-triflouromethyl-4-methylpiperazinepheny), shared by ALW-II-41-27, HG-6-63-01 and XMD15-44, that may be optimized in order to develop potent and selective RET inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers sustaining oncogenic activation of RET.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Germline and somatic point mutations of RET receptor tyrosine kinase cause multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 syndromes and sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). Moreover, RET gene rearrangements are associated to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), lung adenocarcinoma (ADC) and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Recently Vandetanib (ZD6474), a multiple kinase inhibitor (KI) targeting RET, has been approved for MTC treatment. We tested 22 novel KIs with different structure and specificity for their ability to inhibit RET activity in NIH3T3 fibroblasts expressing MTC-associated RET C634R and M918T oncogenic mutants. Among them, we selected three structurally similar type II tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ALW-II-41-27, HG-6-63-01 and XMD15-44, that were able to significantly reduce RET phosphorylation at 10 nM dose. ALW-II-41-27, HG-6-63-01 and XMD15-44 blocked RET-mediated signaling and proliferation with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than 50 nM in rat fibroblasts transformed by RET/C634R and RET/M918T, while they were poorly effective on parental RAT1 cells (IC50 >200nM). Although with different efficacy, the three compounds inhibited various MTC-associated RET intracellular mutants (RET E768D, L790F, Y791F, S891A, V804L/M and A883F) and RET chimeric oncogenes (RET/PTC1, RET/PTC3, KIF5B-RET and FGFR1OP-RET). In addition, ALW-II-41-27, HG-6-63-01 and XMD15-44 inhibited RET activity and signaling in human cell lines (TT, MZCRC1 and TPC1) carrying oncogenic RET alleles (C634W, M918T and RET/PTC1, respectively) and blocked the growth of TT and MZCRC1 cells with an IC50 of 1-5 nM and of TPC1 cells with an IC50 of 10-50 nM. Proliferation of non-tumoral human thyroid follicular cells (Nthy-ori 3-1) growth was virtually unaffected (IC50 nM). Finally, in nude mice, ALW-II-41-27 (40 mg/kg i.p once per day) reduced growth of RET/C634Y-fibroblast xenografts by more than 50% (1,280 mm3 drug-treated vs 2,810 mm3 vehicle-treated). In conclusion, we have identified a pharmacophore (3-triflouromethyl-4-methylpiperazinepheny), shared by ALW-II-41-27, HG-6-63-01 and XMD15-44, that may be optimized in order to develop potent and selective RET inhibitors for the treatment of human cancers sustaining oncogenic activation of RET.\n",

      "Full Abstract: Preclinical evidence shows that hitting a single point along the RAF/MEK/ERK cascade disrupts intra-pathway negative feedback loop, may cause paradoxical pathway activation and may lead to functional resistance. Thus, the vertical combination of agents simultaneously inhibiting RAF and MEK has been proposed as a strategy to synergistically inhibit tumor growth and delay resistance. Experimental procedures: Molecular and functional effects of single and combined MEK (using trametinib, T), BRAF (using dabrafenib, D), and RAF (using the pan-RAF inhibitor, RAF265, R) inhibition were dissected by WB analysis and conservative isobologram analysis to assess functional synergism, using a fixed dose-ratio experimental design. Summary data: We examined the in vitro molecular and functional consequences of D and T, alone or in combination, in a panel of different human BRAFV600E melanoma cell lines; both drugs inhibited cell growth and inactivated the MAPK pathway, but little or no synergistic growth inhibition was observed with their combination (CI: 0.7 - 1.3x106). Conversely, combined D+T suppressed malignant growth with highly synergistic effects in KRAS-mutant lung (2/5 cell lines tested) and pancreatic (4/6 cell lines tested) cancer models (CI: 0.1 - 0.7), in which selective BRAF inhibition induced hyperphosphorylation of MEK, ERK, and p90RSK (paradox effect). At concentrations inhibiting both BRAF and CRAF, R did not induce paradox MAPK activation and did not result in growth inhibitory synergism when combined with T. To define the role of RAS gene status in determining sensitivity/resistance to single and combined RAF and MEK blockade, we analyzed two isogenic tumor cell line models: H1299 expressing individual codon 12 KRAS mutants and isogenic HCT116 clones differing for the presence of a homo or heterozygous G13D KRAS mutation. Conversely, in lung cancer models driven by either EGFR mutations (HCC827, H1650) or HER-2 overexpression (Calu-3), selective BRAF inhibition also induced a paradox MAPK activation, which could be blocked using a reversible EGFR/HER-2 inhibitor (Lapatinib); in this context, combination (D+T) resulted in a non-synergic growth inhibitory effects. Conclusions: Overall, our data indicate that, in appropriate cellular contexts, vertical RAF/MEK inhibition-based combination strategies exert highly synergistic antitumor effects across different cancer models.

      "Title: P6-03-06: ESR1 mutant alleles induce differential sensitivity to combination endocrine and targeted therapies\n",
      "Abstract: Background: Estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) mutations in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) metastatic breast cancer drive the development of acquired resistance to endocrine therapy. However, ESR1 mutation status does not currently guide treatment decisions due to a lack of comparative data on sensitivity to clinically approved or investigational combination therapies. The goal of our study was to quantify how the two most common ESR1 mutations, p.D538G and p.Y537S, impact therapeutic sensitivity to different types of endocrine therapy without or with targeted inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). A preclinical competition-based drug treatment platform was developed to monitor expansion of ESR1 mutant subclones as a quantitative measure of therapeutic resistance. Methods: CRISPR/Cas9-based targeting was used to generate two ESR1 mutant (p.D538G or p.Y537S) subclones of the PIK3CA mutation positive ER+ breast cancer cell line, T-47D. Mutant cellular mixtures were generated by spiking-in one or both ESR1 mutant subclones into the parental T-47D cell population at approximately 10% mutant allele frequency (MAF). The mixtures of wild-type and mutant cells were grown for a duration of five weeks in the presence of clinically approved endocrine therapy (50nM Fulvestrant or 1M Tamoxifen) alone or in combination with inhibitors of CDK4/6 (Palbociclib), mTOR (Everolimus), or PI3K (Alpelisib). Cells were sampled every week to quantify changes in overall cell numbers and in ESR1 wild-type and mutant allele frequencies by allele-specific digital PCR assays (Bio-Rad). Cumulative population doublings of wild-type and mutant cells were calculated. Two-tailed t-tests were performed to assess statistical significance. Results: Tamoxifen and fulvestrant treatment of mixed cell populations resulted in clonal selection for both p.D538G and p.Y537S ESR1 mutant alleles, relative to the wild-type allele. However, mixing of both mutant alleles revealed a greater resistance to fulvestrant induced by the p.Y537S allele, which was not observed for tamoxifen. Combination treatment with fulvestrant and inhibitors of CDK4/6, mTOR, or PI3K resulted in greater than 3-fold reduction in the rate of clonal selection for ESR1 p.D538G, relative to fulvestrant alone. In contrast, clonal expansion of ESR1 p.Y537S expressing cells exposed to fulvestrant was only attenuated by co-treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor, and not impacted by inhibitors of either mTOR or PI3K. Thus, cellular mixtures containing both p.D538G and p.Y537S subclones became overtaken (i.e. >90% MAF) by p.Y537S expressing subclones within five weeks of treatment with either fulvestrant plus everolimus or fulvestrant plus alpelisib. Conclusions: A preclinical competition-based model of metastatic breast cancer reveals ESR1 mutant allele-specific differences in therapeutic susceptibility. The ESR1 p.Y537S allele induces greater resistance to fulvestrant, fulvestrant plus everolimus, and fulvestrant plus alpelisib, relative to the ESR1 p.D538G allele. In contrast, ESR1 p.Y537S and ESR1 p.D538G alleles exhibit comparable sensitivity to tamoxifen and fulvestrant plus palbociclib. Clinical validation of these findings may warrant investigation of novel treatment strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance induced by the ESR1 p.Y537S allele.

      "Abstract: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the digestive tract, most of which are sporadic, and familial GISTs with germline mutations are rarely seen. Here, we report a 26-year-old female with a germline p. W557R mutation in exon 11 of the KIT gene. The proband and her father and sister presented with multifocal GIST and pigmented nevi. All 3 patients underwent surgery and imatinib therapy. To date, only 49 kindreds with germline KIT mutations and 6 kindreds with germline PDGFRA mutations have been reported. Summarizing the reported kindreds, the majority of familial GISTs manifest as multiple primary GISTs complicated with special clinical manifestations, including cutaneous hyperpigmentation, dysphagia, mastocytosis, inflammatory fibrous polyps, and large hands. Familial GISTs are generally thought to exhibit TKI sensitivity similar to that of sporadic GISTs with the same mutation.\n",

      "Abstract: To identify the somatic mutated genes for optimal targets of non-small-cell lung cancer after resistance to osimertinib treatment.Study patients all had advanced lung adenocarcinoma and acquired resistance to osimertinib as a second- or third-line treatment. These patients had harboring EGFR T790M mutation before osimertinib treatment, which was confirmed by Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS) PCR or Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS). After resistance to osimertinib treatment, tumor tissue was collected by core needle biopsy. DNA was extracted from 15 5 um sliced section of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) material and NGS was done. The genetic changes were analyzed.A total of 9 Chinese patients were studied, 5 females and 4 males, age 51-89 years. After progression with osimertinib treatment, core needle biopsy was performed and next-generation sequencing was performed. Nine patients had harboring 62 point mutations, 2 altered gene copies, 2 amplifications, and 1 EML4-ALK gene fusion. No MET or HER2 amplification was found in this cohort study. Nine patients still maintained initial EGFR 19 del or L858R activating mutations, while 7 of them kept EGFR T790M mutations. Among the 7 patients, 5 had secondary EGFR C797S and/or C797G mutations, which all happened in the same allele with T790M mutation. All patients were treated with targets therapies, chemotherapy, or best supportive care (BSC) in accordance with NGS genetic results and patients' performance status; 7 of them are still alive and 2 of them died of disease progression at last follow-up.EGFR C797S/G mutation and the same one presented on the same allele with EGFR T790M mutation were the most common mutation feature and played a key role in resistance to osimertinib in Chinese patients with NSCLC. Tumor cells losing T790M mutation and maintaining EGFR activating mutation might benefit from first-generation EGFR-TKI treatment.\n",
