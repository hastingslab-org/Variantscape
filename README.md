## Technologies used
- Python and Jupyter Notebook for execution
- Named Entity Recognition (NER) models (e.g., SciSpaCy) for information extraction
- BioBERT (Biomedical BERT model) for information extraction
- Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., Llama 3.3) for variant extraction and classification
- OpenAlex API (for fetching of biomedical publications)
- CIViC API (for disease and treatment information)
- MyCancerInfo API (for gene name augmentation)
- MyDiseaseInfo API (for disease and cancer type synonyms)
- MyTreatmentInfo API (for treatment synonyms and aliases)
- MONDO API (for cancer ontology mapping and synonyms)
- General classifier (for study design classification)
